'''
Here you can try the macronizer on the included test texts.
Just comment out the input with the text you want, and comment out everything else.

In general, Supplices (ἱκέτιδες in Greek) is in verse and 
a prosodically much more complex text than the straight-forward prose story Anabasis.
This is not a benchmark: I have added quite a few of the proper names of Anabasis to the custom db, 
as an example of the high results that can be achieved by manually "localizing" the macronizer to your target text.

A good work flow is to first run the macronizer as-is on your target text, inspect the list of un-disambiguated words in diagnostics/still_ambiguous, 
and then manually add the most common of them to the db/custom.py. 
Of course, "manually" could mean using a good LLM with research capabilities.
